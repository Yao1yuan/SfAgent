IMPORTANT: Persistence Strategy
Since our session might be interrupted, I want you to maintain a file named readme.md in the root directory.
Initialize: At the very beginning, create readme.md and copy the "Development Roadmap" checklist from the instruction.md into it.
Update: After completing EACH step and passing tests, you MUST edit readme.md to mark that step as [x] Completed.
Context: If I restart the session, your first action should always be to read readme.md to see where we left off.
